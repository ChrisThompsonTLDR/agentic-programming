# Headless SDLC Orchestrator Dependencies
# Python 3.8+ required

# Note: This is a functional scaffold demonstrating how markdown-based
# agents can be transformed into code objects. In a production environment,
# you would add:
# - openai>=1.0.0  # For OpenAI Agents SDK
# - pydantic>=2.0.0  # For data validation
# - python-dotenv>=1.0.0  # For environment configuration

# Currently no external dependencies required for basic functionality
# All functionality uses Python standard library
