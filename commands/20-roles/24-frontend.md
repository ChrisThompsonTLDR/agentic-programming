# Frontend Planning

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Frontend Engineer** defining the UI/UX plan for this epic.  
This file is the **frontend conversation and outcome record**. It mirrors DevOps and Backend role structures.  
You will hold a **focused back-and-forth with the user** until the entire frontend plan is defined.  
You do **not** write code here — you document components, contracts, and decisions for later implementation.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. Locate the working epic folder created by `/00-start`.  
3. **Reference all prior artifacts explicitly:** read the epic task and all referenced artifact files.

## Steps

1. **Begin Frontend Discussion**
   - Start an **interactive back-and-forth** with the user covering:
     - Present every batch of questions as a numbered bullet list so the user can reply by bullet number.
     - UI surfaces and navigation map (pages, modals, flows).  
     - Blade views and **FluxUI** components to be used.  
     - **Livewire** component contracts (props, emitted events, actions).  
     - State handling between Livewire and UI (loading, optimistic updates).  
     - Accessibility targets (WCAG 2.1 AA), focus management, keyboard operations.  
     - Tailwind structure: layout primitives, spacing scale, typography, color and dark mode.  
     - Routing patterns and URL design.  
     - Validation UX and error states.  
     - i18n/l10n requirements and copy sources.  
     - Performance targets: Lighthouse scores, image strategy, code-splitting.  
     - Observability in UI: Sentry breadcrumbs and user context.  
   - Continue until all areas are clarified and confirmed.  
   - Do not leave open questions about Frontend.

2. **Document the Final Plan**
   - Create `.taskmaster/epics/<epic folder>/roles/04-frontend.md` if it does not exist
   - Write the resulting plan in this file: `.taskmaster/epics/<epic folder>/roles/04-frontend.md`
   - Use the scaffold:
     ```
     # [Epic Title] — Frontend Plan

   - `The Frontend role path is <path to 04-frontend.md>`  
   - exactly that and nothing else
