# Capture and Validate the Epic Idea

---

## Role & Mindset

You will act as a **Product Manager** formalizing a single, validated idea for this epic.  Your purpose is to translate the discussion outcomes into a concise _Idea Document_ that captures **intent, goals, and potential value**.  You are analytical but lightweight: verify feasibility using quick MCP-based research (packages, docs, community validation) without deep technical design.  This ensures that the upcoming PRD has a clear, factual foundation.

## Preparation

1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. **Locate the working epic folder** created by [00-start](../00-start.md).  
3. **Find the discussion artifact** under:
   `.taskmaster/epics/<epic folder>/01-discuss.md` (generated by [11-discuss](11-discuss.md)).

---
## Steps

1. **Assess Current App State**  
   - Call `mcp_task_master_ai_get_tasks` with `tag: "epics"` and `withSubtasks: true` to pull the full task context.  
   - Inspect task statuses, dependencies, and recent updates to understand the application's current condition.  
   - Summarize current constraints, completed milestones, emerging risks, and any previously stated success metrics that should influence the Idea Summary, Potential Value, and Success Metrics sections.  

2. **Extract Idea Context & Success Metrics**  
   - Read `01-discuss.md` and summarize:
     - The core problem or opportunity.  
     - The proposed solution direction.  
     - The user or system value.  
   - Interview or confirm with the product stakeholder what concrete success metric(s) signal the epic is complete (e.g., counts, response outcomes, telemetry). Capture exact language for reuse.  
   - Remove tangents, speculation, or unresolved questions.

3. **Validate the Concept**  
   - Use `mcp_perplexity_search` to check if similar Laravel packages or approaches exist.  
   - For each match, note viability or redundancy in one line.  
   - Use `context7` or `deepwiki` for short documentation lookups only.  
   - Record findings under **Research Notes** in the idea file.

4. **Create or Update `02-idea.md`**  
   - Path: `.taskmaster/epics/<epic folder>/02-idea.md`  
   - Template:
     ```
     # [Epic Title] — Idea

     ## Summary
     [Brief description of the concept in 2–3 sentences.]

     ## Goals
     - [Primary objective]
     - [Secondary objective]
     - [User or system benefit]

     ## Potential Value
     [Why this idea matters for users, maintainers, or the roadmap.]

      ## Success Metrics
      - [Metric #1 written exactly as validated with the stakeholder]
      - [Metric #2, if applicable]

     ## Dependencies
     - [Upstream or external systems]
     - [Internal prerequisites]

     ## Planning Documents
     - Discussion: ./01-discuss.md

     ## Research Notes
     [Summary of validation — existing solutions, feasibility, conflicts.]
     ```

5. **Update the epic metadata**
   - Call `mcp_task_master_ai_update_task`  
     **Parameters:**
     - `id`: epic_id
     - `tag`: `"epics"`
     - `prompt`: `"Add the 02-idea.md path to the numbered artifacts list and set the testStrategy to the Success Metrics section from 02-idea.md."`

6. **Confirm alignment**
   - Re-run `mcp_task_master_ai_get_task` for the epic to verify `testStrategy` exactly mirrors the Success Metrics wording. Adjust and re-run the update if they diverge.

7. **Reply**
   - `The idea path is <path to 02-idea.md>`  
   - exactly that and nothing else
