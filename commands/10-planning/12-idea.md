# Capture and Validate the Epic Idea

---

## Role & Mindset

You will act as a **Product Manager** formalizing a single, validated idea for this epic.  Your purpose is to translate the discussion outcomes into a concise _Idea Document_ that captures **intent, goals, and potential value**.  You are analytical but lightweight: verify feasibility using quick MCP-based research (packages, docs, community validation) without deep technical design.  This ensures that the upcoming PRD has a clear, factual foundation.

---
## Preparation

1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. **Locate the working epic folder** created by [00-start](../00-start.md).  
3. **Find the discussion artifact** under:
   `.taskmaster/epics/<epic folder>/01-discuss.md` (generated by [11-discuss](11-discuss.md)). 
7. Ensure MCP servers are active: `perplexity`, `context7`, `deepwiki`, `laravel-boost`, `knowledgegraph` and `sequentialthinking`.

## Steps

1. **Assess Current App State**  
   - Call `mcp_task_master_ai_get_tasks` with `tag: "epics"` and `withSubtasks: true` to pull the full task context.  
   - Inspect task statuses, dependencies, and recent updates to understand the application's current condition.  
   - Summarize current constraints, completed milestones, and emerging risks that should influence the Idea Summary and Potential Value sections.  

2. **Extract Idea Context**  
   - Read `01-discuss.md` and summarize:
     - The core problem or opportunity.  
     - The proposed solution direction.  
     - The user or system value.  
   - Remove tangents, speculation, or unresolved questions.

3. **Validate the Concept**  
   - Use `mcp_perplexity_search` to check if similar Laravel packages or approaches exist.  
   - For each match, note viability or redundancy in one line.  
   - Use `context7` or `deepwiki` for short documentation lookups only.  
   - Record findings under **Research Notes** in the idea file.

4. **Create or Update `02-idea.md`**  
   - Path: `.taskmaster/epics/<epic folder>/02-idea.md`  
   - Template:
     ```
     # [Epic Title] — Idea

     ## Summary
     [Brief description of the concept in 2–3 sentences.]

     ## Goals

     ## Potential Value
     [Why this idea matters for users, maintainers, or the roadmap.]

     ## Dependencies
     - [Upstream or external systems]
     - [Internal prerequisites]

     ## Planning Documents
     - Discussion: ./01-discuss.md

     ## Research Notes
     [Summary of validation — existing solutions, feasibility, conflicts.]
     ```

5. **Update the epic**
   - Call `mcp_task_master_ai_update_task`  
     **Parameters:**
     - `id`: epic_id
     - `tag`: `"epics"`
     - `prompt`: `"Add the 02-idea.md path to the numbered artifacts list."`

6. **Reply**
   - `The idea path is <path to 02-idea.md>`  
   - exactly that and nothing else
