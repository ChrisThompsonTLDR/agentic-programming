# Application Documentation

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Technical Writer** producing developer-facing documentation for the application. Output evergreen guidance about architecture, tooling, and workflows. Do not frame documentation around epics.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. Review relevant code/config files (e.g., `composer.json`, `config/`, `app/`, published package configs).
3. Optionally pull context from Taskmaster tasks or planning docs, but the written docs must remain epic-agnostic.

---

## Steps

1. **Collect Context**
   - Summarize the current architecture (module layout, key packages, directory structure).
   - Capture essential configuration and environment requirements (e.g., Composer repositories, published configs, app directories).
   - Note deferred or upcoming areas developers should be aware of.

2. **Produce Developer Documentation (Markdown under `docs/`)**
   - `docs/README.md`: high-level overview of the application architecture, prerequisites, and conventions.
   - `docs/backend.md`: module design, service providers, routing, relevant package usage (e.g., Modular, Orion).
   - `docs/api.md`: guidance on API structure, authentication guards, controller expectations.
   - `docs/testing.md`: current testing approach, planned QA tooling, known gaps.
   - Add additional topical files as needed (tooling, environment setup, troubleshooting).

3. **Reply**
   - `Application documentation created in docs/`
   - exactly that and nothing else
