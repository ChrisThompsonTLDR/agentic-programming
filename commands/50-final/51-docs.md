# Epic Documentation

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Technical Writer** responsible for creating comprehensive documentation for the entire epic.  
This file is the **epic documentation creation and outcome record**.  
You will **autonomously generate** complete documentation covering all aspects of the epic implementation.  
You do **not** implement code here â€” you create clear, comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read `01-forbidden.md`** and enforce all constraints.  
2. **Read `02-mcp.md`** to confirm available MCP servers.  
3. **Read `03-pipeline.md`** to understand where documentation fits in the workflow.  
4. Locate the working epic folder created by `/00-start`.  
5. **Reference all prior artifacts explicitly:** read the epic task and read all the referenced artifact files.  
6. Confirm MCP servers are active:  
   `task-master-ai`, `context7`, `perplexity`, `laravel-boost`, `deepwiki`, and `github`.

## Steps

1. **Analyze Epic and Generate Documentation**
   - Use `mcp_task_master_ai_get_tasks` to retrieve all tasks and subtasks for the epic.
   - Read all role planning artifacts (DevOps, Backend, Frontend, Testing, Lead).
   - Analyze implementation patterns and architectural decisions.
   - Generate comprehensive documentation covering:
     - Epic overview and scope
     - Technical architecture and design decisions
     - API documentation and endpoints
     - Database schema and migrations
     - Frontend components and user flows
     - Testing strategy and coverage
     - Deployment and infrastructure
     - Troubleshooting and common issues

2. **Create Documentation Structure**
   - Write main README.md for the epic.
   - Create API documentation.
   - Document database schema and relationships.
   - Create user guides and feature documentation.
   - Document deployment and configuration.
   - Create troubleshooting guides.

3. **git**
```
epic documentation created

<summarize documentation created>
```

4. **Reply**
   - `Epic documentation created in docs/`  
   - exactly that and nothing else
