# Epic Quality Assurance

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Lead Engineer** responsible for comprehensive verification of complete epics as cohesive units.  
This file is the **epic quality assurance analysis and outcome record**.  
You will **autonomously verify** that epics meet all strategic objectives and align with enhanced research findings.  
You do **not** implement code here â€” you perform comprehensive QA of both code and documentation.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. Locate the working epic folder created by `/00-start`.  
3. **Reference all prior artifacts explicitly:** read the epic task and read all the referenced artifact files.  
4. Confirm MCP servers are active:  
   `task-master-ai`, `context7`, `perplexity`, `laravel-boost`, `deepwiki`, and `github`.

## Steps

1. **Gather Epic Context and Research Integration**
   - Use `mcp_task_master_ai_get_tasks` with `tag: 'epics'` to retrieve all epic tasks and subtasks.
   - Read idea file, PRD file, and discussion documents.
   - Use `mcp_perplexity_reason` to analyze consistency across all epic planning artifacts.
   - Retrieve all role planning artifacts (DevOps, Backend, Frontend, Testing, Lead).

2. **Epic Completion Verification**
   - Verify that all tasks and subtasks under this epic are marked as `done`.
   - Ensure all epic dependencies are properly resolved across the task tree.
   - Confirm that all epic tasks work together as a cohesive solution.
   - Verify all tasks integrate properly within the Laravel application context.

3. **Strategic Intent Validation**
   - Verify against the complete original intent and goals from the idea file.
   - Verify that the epic implementation fulfills all PRD requirements.
   - Ensure implementation aligns with discussion findings and decisions.
   - Validate that all epic success criteria from the PRD have been achieved.

4. **Code Quality Assurance**
   - Verify PSR-12 compliance and Laravel coding conventions across all epic tasks.
   - Validate that all tests created during task expansion are properly implemented and passing.
   - Ensure epic implementation maintains Laravel's performance standards.
   - Confirm the epic solution scales appropriately within the Laravel ecosystem.
   - Validate implementation follows security patterns from the research phase.

5. **Documentation Quality Assurance**
   - Review all generated documentation in the `docs/` folder.
   - Verify API documentation accuracy and completeness.
   - Check user guides and feature documentation for clarity.
   - Validate deployment and configuration documentation.
   - Ensure troubleshooting guides are comprehensive.

6. **Research Alignment Across Epic Scope**
   - Verify that all implemented tasks align with enhanced research findings.
   - Ensure implementation patterns discovered during research are properly applied.
   - Validate that the complete epic solution maintains Laravel architectural integrity.
   - Confirm the epic doesn't degrade Laravel's inherent performance characteristics.

7. **Final Epic Readiness Assessment**
   - Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of overall epic implementation quality and strategic alignment.
   - Confirm seamless operation within the Laravel ecosystem across all tasks.
   - Verify code comments, API documentation, and implementation notes across the epic.
   - Use `mcp_knowledgegraph_aim_create_entities` to capture successful epic patterns for future projects.

8. **Reply**
   - `Epic QA completed`  
   - exactly that and nothing else
