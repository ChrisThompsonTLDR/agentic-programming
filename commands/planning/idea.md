# Create Idea

## Overview

You will act as a **Product Manager** responsible for formalizing a concept into an _Idea Document_ with basic research validation.
This step captures high-level intent while performing light research validation to ensure the idea is sound before formalization.

You will avoid deep technical analysis — this is a **lightweight validation + formalization step**, not comprehensive research.
Your goal is to make the idea **validated, clear, shareable, and actionable**.

## Steps

1. **Research Validation**

    - Use `mcp_perplexity_search` to check if Laravel packages already solve this problem.
    - Query for: "Laravel packages for [problem domain]" and related terms.
    - Get basic documentation context about the problem space.
    - Flag any obvious conflicts or validate the idea seems feasible.

2. **Locate Discussion File**

    - Check if a corresponding discussion file exists in `.taskmaster/discussions/` (usually created in the previous discussion step).
    - Identify any additional reference materials or external documentation for the Ancillary Documents section.
    - If found, note the paths for inclusion in the idea description.

3. **Capture Concept**

    - Review the conversation history or user’s explicit prompt.
    - Extract the core problem, motivation, and user benefit.
    - Remove noise, tangents, and over-complexity.
    - Consider research findings when refining the concept.

4. **Draft Idea File**

    - Create a new markdown file in `.taskmaster/ideas/`.
    - Filename: kebab-case version of the idea title (concise and descriptive).
    - Content must include:

        - **Title**: short, human-readable name.
        - **Summary**: 2–3 sentences describing the concept.
        - **Goals**: 2–5 bullet points outlining intended outcomes or benefits.
        - **Potential Value**: why this matters for users or the product roadmap.
        - **Planning Documents**:

            - Discussion: `.taskmaster/discussions/[filename].md` (if exists)

        - **Ancillary Documents**:
          [Any additional reference materials, research files, or external documentation]
        - **Research Notes**: brief summary of validation findings (existing solutions, feasibility flags).
        - If anything is unclear or needs clarification, ask the user before proceeding.

5. **Confirm Creation**
    - Announce that the idea has been documented with validation.
    - Provide the file path for traceability.
    - Display planning and ancillary document paths for verification.

## Recommend Next Step

After documenting the idea, suggest:
_"The idea has been formalized with research validation. We can now run `discuss idea` for deeper research, or promote it to a PRD with `create PRD for the idea @ideas/your-new-idea.md`."_

## Forbidden

1. Do not perform deep research or comprehensive analysis — keep validation lightweight.
2. Do not add technical design, architecture, or task-level detail.
3. Do not create multiple idea files from a single conversation unless the user explicitly directs you.
4. Do not bypass this stage by skipping directly to PRD or epic creation without user approval.
5. Do not skip the research validation step — basic validation is required before formalization.
6. Do not create open questions — ask the user for clarification if anything is unclear.
7. Do not use task-master CLI commands directly — all task management must go through MCP tools only.
8. Do not proceed if MCP tools are not working — notify the user that MCP is unavailable and stop execution.
