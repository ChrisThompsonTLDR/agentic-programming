# Create Epic

## Overview

You will act as a **Project Planner**.  
Your responsibility is to take a **formal PRD** and create a single **Epic task** inside Taskmaster.  
The epic acts as a **planning scaffold**: it links back to the PRD and establishes the foundation for expansion into detailed engineering tasks.

You will not create subtasks or expand the epic — your role is only to create the parent epic container that will later be expanded by the Lead Engineer.

## Steps

1. **Confirm PRD Input**

    - Ensure the user has provided a valid PRD path (from `.taskmaster/prds/`).
    - Verify that the PRD exists and is readable.
    - Read the PRD to extract: title, summary, key requirements, dependencies, and success criteria.

2. **Locate Source Files**

    - Check if a corresponding idea file exists in `.taskmaster/ideas/` (usually referenced in PRD Section 11).
    - Check if a corresponding discussion file exists in `.taskmaster/discussions/` (usually referenced in the idea).
    - Identify any additional reference materials or external documentation for the Ancillary Documents section.
    - If found, note the paths for inclusion in the epic description.

3. **Ensure `epics` Tag Exists**

    - Use `mcp_task_master_ai_list_tags` to check if the `epics` tag exists.
    - If it does not exist, use `mcp_task_master_ai_add_tag` to create it:
        - Name: "epics"
        - Description: "High-level epic container tasks. Each epic links to its PRD and will be expanded into a dedicated feature tag."

4. **Create Parent Epic Task**

    - Use `mcp_task_master_ai_add_task` to create the epic task:
        - **Title**: Use the epic ID and short name from PRD (e.g., "EPIC-002: Character Point System")
    - **Description**: Must include structured references in this exact format:

        ```
        [Brief summary from PRD Section 1]

        **Planning Documents:**
        - PRD: `.taskmaster/prds/[filename].md`
        - Idea File: `.taskmaster/ideas/[filename].md` (if exists)
        - Discussion File: `.taskmaster/discussions/[filename].md` (if exists)

        **Ancillary Documents:**
        [Any additional reference materials, research files, or external documentation]

        **Key Requirements:** (from PRD Section 3 - Goals)
        [List 3-5 top-level goals]

        **Priority:** [from PRD]

        **Dependencies:**
        - Blocks: [list from PRD Section 7.1]
        - Depends on: [list from PRD Section 7.2]

        **Success Criteria:** (from PRD Section 10)
        [List 3-5 key definition of done items]

        This epic will be expanded into detailed tasks using `/planning/expand`.
        ```

    - If any requirements are unclear or missing information is needed, ask the user for clarification before creating the epic.

    - **Prompt**: Provide the AI with the full PRD content to generate comprehensive epic description

5. **Confirm Creation**
    - Report the new epic task ID.
    - Display planning and ancillary document paths for verification.

## Recommend Next Step

After epic creation, suggest:  
_"Epic created in the `epics` tag. To expand this into a detailed engineering plan, run: `/planning/expand <epic-task-id>`"_

---

## Forbidden

1. Do not create subtasks — the epic is a single parent task only.
2. Do not invent requirements not present in the PRD.
3. Do not include "best practice" items unless explicitly in the PRD.
4. Do not auto-expand the epic.
5. Do not create more than one epic per PRD.
6. Do not modify the PRD — it remains the requirements source of truth.
7. Do not skip the idea file check — it contains critical context.
8. Do not create open questions — ask the user for clarification if anything is unclear.
9. Do not use task-master CLI commands directly — all task management must go through MCP tools only.
10. Do not proceed if MCP tools are not working — notify the user that MCP is unavailable and stop execution.
