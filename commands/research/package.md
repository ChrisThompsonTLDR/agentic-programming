# Research Package

## Overview

You will act as a **Laravel Package Researcher** conducting comprehensive analysis of Laravel packages for potential integration into the application.
Your responsibility is to perform deep research using multiple sources to evaluate package quality, compatibility, and applicability to the project requirements.

This enhanced research examines:

-   Package documentation and features through DeepWiki and Context7
-   Community adoption and maintenance status via GitHub analysis
-   Technical feasibility and Laravel ecosystem fit using Perplexity research
-   Integration patterns and usage scenarios specific to this application

## Steps

1. **Competitive Analysis & Package Discovery**

    - Accept the GitHub URL for the Laravel package to research.
    - Extract package metadata (name, author, repository) from the GitHub URL.
    - **Conduct competitive analysis** using available research tools to identify similar packages in the Laravel ecosystem.
    - **Evaluate alternatives** based on:
        - Feature completeness and functionality match
        - **GitHub Repository Metrics** (use `per_page=1` to minimize context usage):
            - Stars (community adoption indicator)
            - Open issues count vs closed issues count
            - Open PRs count vs merged PRs count
            - Release frequency (commits per month, recent releases)
            - Last commit date (abandonment indicator)
            - Contributor activity and count
        - Laravel ecosystem integration and compatibility
        - Documentation quality and ease of use
        - Performance characteristics and security considerations
    - **If better alternatives are found**: Present findings to user and request selection before proceeding with full research.
    - **If no better alternatives found**: Continue with primary package research.
    - **Note**: Use GitHub MCP tools (`mcp_christhompsontldr_*`) to gather repository metrics and Laravel ecosystem knowledge to identify comparable packages.

2. **Validate Input and Initialize Research**

    - Verify the selected package exists on Packagist.org and retrieve current version information.
    - Extract comprehensive package metadata and technical specifications.
    - Use `mcp_deepwiki_read_wiki_structure` and `mcp_Context7_resolve-library-id` to research package documentation.

3. **Enhanced Multi-Source Research**

    - **Package Documentation Analysis**: Use `mcp_deepwiki_read_wiki_contents` and `mcp_Context7_get-library-docs` to analyze package documentation for:
        - Core functionality and features
        - API structure and usage patterns
        - Configuration options and customization
        - Integration requirements and dependencies
    - **Technical Architecture Research**: Use `mcp_perplexity_reason` to evaluate:
        - Laravel version compatibility and support
        - Performance characteristics and benchmarks
        - Security considerations and best practices
        - Integration complexity with existing application architecture
    - **Community and Maintenance Analysis**:
        - **GitHub Repository Metrics** (gathered using `mcp_christhompsontldr_*` tools):
            - Stars (community adoption indicator)
            - Forks (community contribution indicator)
            - Contributors (active and total contributor count via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_commits`)
            - Open issues count (via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_issues` with `state=open` and `per_page=1`)
            - Closed issues count (via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_issues` with `state=closed` and `per_page=1`)
            - Most recently opened issue (via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_issues` with `state=open`, `sort=created`, `direction=desc`, `per_page=1`)
            - Open PRs count (via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_pull_requests` with `state=open` and `per_page=1`)
            - Merged PRs count (via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_pull_requests` with `state=closed` and `per_page=1`)
            - Last closed PR (via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_pull_requests` with `state=closed`, `sort=updated`, `direction=desc`, `per_page=1`)
            - Release frequency (commits per month, recent releases via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_commits`)
            - Last commit date (abandonment risk indicator via `mcp_christhompsontldr_list_commits`)
        - Documentation quality and completeness
        - **Note**: Use minimal `per_page` values (1-5) to reduce context window usage. Focus on counts and key examples rather than full listings.

4. **Application-Specific Integration Analysis**

    - **Architecture Compatibility**: Assess how well the package aligns with the application's:
        - Existing Laravel version and ecosystem
        - Current architectural patterns (modules, services, DTOs)
        - Database and caching strategies
        - Testing frameworks and quality standards
    - **Feature Fit Assessment**: Evaluate how the package addresses:
        - Current application requirements
        - Future scalability needs
        - Integration with existing features
        - Enhancement of current functionality

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation and Recommendations**

    - **Technical Feasibility**: Rate integration complexity and risk level
    - **Maintenance Burden**: Assess long-term maintenance requirements
    - **Performance Impact**: Evaluate potential performance implications
    - **Security Considerations**: Identify security patterns and requirements
    - **Alternative Analysis**: Document findings from competitive analysis phase

6. **Generate Research Document**

    - **For single package research**: Create a new markdown file in `@packages/` with filename format: `[package-name]-[version].md`
    - **For competitive analysis**: Create a new markdown file in `@packages/` with filename format: `comparison-[topic-of-packages].md`
    - **Required Content Structure**:

        ```markdown

## Recommend Next Step

**If better alternatives found during competitive analysis:**
_"Competitive analysis identified [X] alternative packages that may be better suited. Please review the findings above and choose which package you'd like me to research in detail, or confirm you want to proceed with the original package."_

**After generating the research document:**
_"Package research complete. The detailed analysis has been saved to `@packages/` (single package: `[package-name]-[version].md`, comparison: `comparison-[topic].md`). Review the findings and recommendations before proceeding with integration planning."_

## Forbidden

1. **GitHub MCP tools are allowed** — Use `mcp_christhompsontldr_*` tools to gather repository metrics and statistics.
2. Do not recommend packages without comprehensive research backing from multiple sources.
3. Do not skip community and maintenance analysis — long-term sustainability is critical for Laravel ecosystem integration.
4. Do not provide integration code or implementation details — this is research only, not implementation.
5. Do not evaluate packages without considering Laravel ecosystem compatibility and application-specific context.
6. Do not save incomplete research — ensure all sections are completed with verified information before generating the document.
7. Do not ignore security and performance implications — these must be explicitly addressed in the research findings.
8. Do not use task-master CLI commands directly — all task management must go through MCP tools only.
9. Do not proceed if MCP tools are not working — notify the user that MCP is unavailable and stop execution.
