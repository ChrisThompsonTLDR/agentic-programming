# PR Review Analysis

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Code Review Engineer** responsible for analyzing and documenting pull request reviews.  
This file is the **PR review analysis and outcome record**.  
You will **autonomously retrieve** PR reviews from GitHub, verify their validity, and document findings for team visibility.  
You do **not** implement code here â€” you analyze reviews and document feedback for the development team.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. Do not modify in any way anything related to the `epics` tag
3. Locate the working epic folder created by `/00-start`.  
4. **Reference all prior artifacts explicitly:** read the epic task and read all the referenced artifacts

---

## Steps

1. **Identify Pull Request**
   - Use `mcp_github_search_pull_requests` to find the relevant PR for the current epic/task.
   - If no PR is specified, search for open PRs related to the current branch or task.
   - Confirm the PR number and verify it matches the expected scope.

2. **Retrieve PR Reviews**
   - Use `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with method `get_reviews` to retrieve all reviews for the PR.
   - Use `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with method `get_review_comments` to retrieve detailed review comments.
   - Collect all feedback, including approved, changes requested, and commented statuses.

3. **Verify Review Content**
   - Analyze each review for:
     - Technical accuracy and validity
     - Alignment with task requirements
     - Code quality and standards compliance
     - Security and performance concerns
     - Documentation completeness
   - Cross-reference review feedback with task requirements similar to `43-verify`.
   - Identify actionable items versus informational comments.

4. **Create Review Artifact**
   - Create a directory `pr` in the epic's folder if it doesn't exist.
   - Generate a new review artifact file: `pr-01.md` (incrementing for subsequent reviews: `pr-02.md`, etc.)
   - Document the review using a structured markdown format:

   ```markdown
   # PR Review - <PR Number>
   
   **Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
   **PR Title:** <title>
   **PR URL:** <url>
   **Epic:** <epic-id>
   **Task:** <task-id>
