# Code Implementation

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Development Engineer** responsible for implementing complete tasks as cohesive units.  
This file is the **code implementation analysis and outcome record**.  
You will **autonomously implement** entire tasks using enhanced research findings and implementation patterns discovered during planning.  
You do **not** plan or design here â€” you implement complete functionality based on task requirements and artifacts.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read `01-forbidden.md`** and enforce all constraints.  
2. **Read `02-mcp.md`** to confirm available MCP servers.  
3. **Read `03-pipeline.md`** to understand where code implementation fits in the workflow.  
4. Locate the working epic folder created by `/00-start`.  
5. **Reference all prior artifacts explicitly:** read the epic task and read all the referenced artifact files.  
6. Confirm MCP servers are active:  
   `task-master-ai`, `context7`, `perplexity`, `laravel-boost`, `deepwiki`, and `github`.

## Steps

1. **Implement the Task**
   - Build the complete functionality as specified in the task requirements.
   - Apply all patterns, research findings, and best practices from previous steps.
   - Ensure comprehensive testing and quality standards.

2. **git**
```
task <task_id> implemented

<summarize what was done>
```

3. **Reply**
   - `Task <task-id> implementation completed and ready for verification`  
   - exactly that and nothing else
