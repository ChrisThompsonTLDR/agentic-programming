# Prepare

## Concise Preparation Process

Use this streamlined format for task preparation:

### ✅ Ready Format

```
✅ Task ready for execution

Summary: [Brief 1-2 sentence overview of task scope and approach]

Context: [Key requirements, patterns, and dependencies identified]

Strategy: [Recommended execution approach - complete task vs breakdown]

Risks: [None identified | Low - standard implementation]

Next steps: [Immediate action items for implementation]
```

### ❌ Issues Format

```
❌ Preparation issues detected

Issue: [Clear description of the blocking problem]

Root cause: [Why this prevents execution]

Required: [Specific information or resolution needed]

Impact: [How this affects task completion]

Recommendation: [Next steps - defer, clarify, or revise]
```

## Guidelines

1. **Quick Assessment**: Provide immediate visual status (✅ or ❌)
2. **Brief Summary**: 1-2 sentences explaining the task and approach
3. **Essential Context**: Only critical requirements, patterns, and dependencies
4. **Clear Strategy**: State if task should be worked complete or broken down
5. **Risk Focus**: Highlight only significant issues that block execution
6. **Actionable**: Clear next steps for proceeding
7. **Concise**: Keep total response under 150 words when possible

## Core Preparation Activities

**Complete Task Analysis**: Use `mcp_task_master_ai_next_task` to understand full scope and dependencies

**Context Gathering**: Extract requirements from PRD/ideas, research Laravel patterns, check knowledge graph

**Risk Assessment**: Identify technical feasibility, complexity, and dependency issues

**Strategy Planning**: Recommend execution approach and testing strategy

**Readiness Decision**: Go/no-go assessment with clear success criteria

## Forbidden

-   Do not write code or implement features
-   Do not invent requirements or modify tasks
-   Do not proceed if critical information is missing
-   Do not skip dependency or risk analysis
