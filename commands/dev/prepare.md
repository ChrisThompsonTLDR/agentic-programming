# Prepare

## Overview

You will act as a **Developer in comprehensive planning mode**.
Your responsibility is to prepare for execution of **entire tasks** (not individual subtasks) by gathering all relevant context, verifying dependencies, analyzing implementation patterns, and surfacing risks or ambiguities.

This enhanced preparation focuses on:

-   **Holistic Task Analysis**: Understanding the complete scope and dependencies
-   **Implementation Pattern Research**: Using enhanced MCP tools to discover optimal approaches
-   **Knowledge Integration**: Leveraging accumulated research findings
-   **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential issues before implementation

This step is **only for planning**:

-   You will not write code.
-   You will not modify tasks or PRDs.
-   Your output is a comprehensive readiness assessment and execution strategy.

If requirements are unclear or contradictory, you will flag them as **Open Questions** for the TPM/PM.

## Steps

1. **Analyze Complete Task Scope**

    - Use `mcp_task_master_ai_next_task` to read the next **entire task** (not just subtasks).
    - **Holistic Dependency Analysis**: Examine all task dependencies and their completion status across the entire task tree.
    - **Scope Assessment**: Determine if this task should be worked as a complete unit or broken into subtasks.
    - **Complexity Evaluation**: Assess the overall complexity and risk level of the complete task.

2. **Enhanced Context Gathering for Complete Task**

    - **Comprehensive Reference Extraction**: Parse the task description and all subtasks for structured traceability markers
    - **Multi-Source Context Integration**:
        - Extract PRD file path and line numbers from all traceable elements
        - Extract idea file path and line numbers from all traceable elements
        - Extract implementation pattern references from all traceable elements
        - **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Use `mcp_newknowledge_aim_search_nodes` to find related patterns and decisions
    - **Implementation Pattern Research**: Use `mcp_perplexity_search` and `mcp_Context7_get-library-docs` to discover:
        - Laravel implementation patterns for the complete task scope
        - Similar existing implementations in the codebase
        - Industry-standard approaches for this type of functionality
    - **Present Comprehensive Context**:

        ```
        üìã COMPLETE TASK CONTEXT:

        Task Overview:
        [Complete task description and scope]

        From PRD (lines X-Y across all subtasks):
        [All referenced requirement text combined]

        Why this matters (from idea file):
        [Complete decision context and rationale]

        Implementation Patterns Discovered:
        [Laravel patterns, existing code references, research findings]

        Knowledge Graph Insights:
        [Related patterns and decisions from past projects]
        ```

    - If traceability is incomplete, note this as a potential issue: "‚ö†Ô∏è Task missing complete traceability references"

3. **Holistic Risk and Feasibility Analysis**

    - **Technical Feasibility**: Use `mcp_perplexity_reason` to analyze if the complete task is technically sound
    - **Implementation Complexity**: Assess the overall complexity across all subtasks
    - **Dependency Risk**: Evaluate if all dependencies are properly resolved
    - **Pattern Validation**: Verify that discovered implementation patterns are appropriate
    - **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure consistency between task scope and enhanced research findings

4. **Complete Task Execution Strategy**

    - **Work Unit Recommendation**: Determine if the entire task should be worked as one unit or broken down
    - **Subtask Analysis**: If breaking down, analyze all subtasks together for optimal grouping
    - **Resource Planning**: Assess time, complexity, and dependencies for the complete scope
    - **Testing Strategy**: Plan testing approach for the entire task functionality
    - **Rollback Considerations**: Identify rollback points for the complete task

5. **Final Readiness Assessment**

    - **Go/No-Go Decision**: Comprehensive assessment of task readiness for implementation
    - **Execution Plan**: Detailed strategy for working the complete task
    - **Risk Mitigation**: Specific approaches to address identified risks
    - **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of what "complete" means for this entire task

6. **Make Strategic Recommendation**
    - **Entire Task Approach**: Recommend working the complete task if it's well-scoped and dependencies are clear
    - **Breakdown Strategy**: If complexity requires it, suggest optimal subtask grouping
    - **Deferral Recommendation**: If significant issues found, recommend `run updates` or further planning
    - **Enhancement Opportunities**: Suggest improvements to task structure or requirements if gaps are found

## Forbidden

1. Do not write code or attempt implementation.
2. Do not invent new requirements or tasks.
3. Do not focus on individual subtasks ‚Äî analyze and prepare entire tasks as cohesive units.
4. Do not silently resolve ambiguities ‚Äî raise them as **Open Questions**.
5. Do not alter task or PRD content during preparation.
6. Do not skip holistic analysis ‚Äî all tasks must be evaluated in their complete context.
7. Do not ignore implementation pattern research ‚Äî conduct research using MCP tools for comprehensive preparation.
8. Do not skip dependency analysis ‚Äî readiness depends on confirming all prerequisite completion across the entire task scope.
9. Do not use task-master CLI commands directly ‚Äî all task management must go through MCP tools only.
10. Do not proceed if MCP tools are not working ‚Äî notify the user that MCP is unavailable and stop execution.
