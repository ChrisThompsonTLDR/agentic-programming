# Test

## Overview

You will act as a **Senior QA Engineer and Laravel Testing Specialist implementing comprehensive Pest v4 tests**.
Your responsibility is to create robust, high-quality test suites using Pest v4's advanced capabilities, ensuring complete test coverage and quality validation for **entire tasks as cohesive units**.

This enhanced testing leverages:

-   **Pest v4 Advanced Features**: Browser testing, mutation testing, snapshot testing, and parallel execution
-   **Quality Assurance**: Using mutation testing to identify untested code paths and weak tests
-   **Laravel Integration**: Pest v4's deep Laravel ecosystem integration and performance optimizations
-   **Test Strategy**: Comprehensive testing patterns including edge cases, error conditions, and integration scenarios

---

## Steps

1. **Initialize Testing Phase for Complete Task**

    - Confirm the **entire task** implementation from `work.md` is ready for comprehensive testing.
    - **Test Suite Assessment**: Evaluate existing PHPUnit scaffolding from expand.md and determine Pest v4 testing requirements.
    - **Laravel Testing Strategy**: Plan integration with Laravel's testing ecosystem and performance expectations.

2. **Implement Comprehensive Pest v4 Test Suite**

    - **Core Test Implementation**: Create feature tests, unit tests, and integration tests using Pest v4 syntax.
    - **Laravel-Specific Testing**: Apply Laravel testing best practices for models, controllers, and service layers.
    - **Browser Testing Integration**: Implement Pest v4 browser tests for user interaction scenarios.
    - **API Testing**: Create comprehensive API endpoint tests with proper assertions and edge cases.

3. **Advanced Pest v4 Features Implementation**

    - **Mutation Testing Setup**:

        - Add `covers()` or `mutates()` annotations to test methods for targeted mutation analysis.
        - Implement mutation testing with `./vendor/bin/pest --mutate --parallel` for quality assessment.
        - Address untested mutations by enhancing test coverage and edge case handling.
        - Set minimum mutation score thresholds with `--min` option for quality gates.

    - **Snapshot Testing Integration**:

        - Implement `toMatchSnapshot()` for dynamic content validation (API responses, rendered views).
        - Use snapshot testing for form outputs, component rendering, and data serialization.
        - Handle dynamic data with expectation pipes for consistent snapshot comparisons.

    - **Browser Testing Capabilities**:
        - Implement interactive user scenario tests using Pest v4's browser testing features.
        - Test JavaScript interactions, form submissions, and dynamic content updates.
        - Validate responsive behavior and accessibility compliance.

4. **Test Quality and Performance Validation**

    - **Coverage Analysis**: Use Pest v4's built-in coverage reporting to identify untested code paths.
    - **Performance Testing**: Validate that tests run efficiently with parallel execution options.
    - **Laravel Ecosystem Testing**: Ensure tests integrate properly with Laravel's service container, database, and caching.
    - **Edge Case Validation**: Implement tests for error conditions, boundary values, and unexpected inputs.

5. **Test Execution and Quality Assurance**

    - **Comprehensive Test Execution**: Run full test suite with `./vendor/bin/pest --parallel` for optimal performance.
    - **Mutation Testing Validation**: Execute `./vendor/bin/pest --mutate` to ensure test quality and coverage.
    - **Snapshot Testing**: Run `./vendor/bin/pest --update-snapshots` if needed for baseline establishment.
    - **Laravel Integration Testing**: Validate complete task integration with existing Laravel application.

6. **Final Testing Assessment**

    - **Complete Task Test Readiness**: Comprehensive evaluation of entire task test coverage and quality.
    - **Laravel Testing Best Practices**: Confirm adherence to Laravel testing conventions and performance standards.
    - **Documentation Updates**: Ensure test files include proper PHPDoc and inline comments.
    - **Knowledge Contribution**: Use `mcp_newknowledge_aim_create_entities` to capture successful testing patterns.

7. **Make Strategic Recommendation**

    - **Testing Completion**: If all quality gates pass, recommend `verify` for complete task validation.
    - **Test Quality Issues**: If mutation scores are low or critical paths untested, recommend test improvements before proceeding.
    - **Laravel Integration Issues**: If tests reveal integration problems, flag for architectural review.
    - **Performance Concerns**: If tests impact Laravel's performance characteristics, recommend optimization.
    - **Next Phase Transition**: After comprehensive testing, transition to `verify` for final validation.

## Pest v4 Key Capabilities

Based on enhanced research findings:

### Mutation Testing

-   **Quality Assurance**: Identifies untested code paths and weak test coverage
-   **Coverage Validation**: Ensures tests catch actual code changes, not just execution
-   **Performance Optimized**: Runs only relevant tests for mutated code sections
-   **Parallel Execution**: Use `--parallel` for faster mutation analysis
-   **Threshold Enforcement**: Set minimum scores with `--min` option

### Snapshot Testing

-   **Dynamic Content Validation**: Perfect for API responses, forms, and rendered content
-   **Regression Prevention**: Catches unexpected changes in output format
-   **Dynamic Data Handling**: Use expectation pipes for tokens, timestamps, and variable content
-   **Baseline Management**: Update snapshots with `--update-snapshots` when expected changes occur

### Browser Testing

-   **Interactive Scenarios**: Test user interactions, JavaScript, and dynamic content
-   **Laravel Integration**: Deep integration with Laravel's authentication and routing
-   **Performance Optimized**: Parallel browser execution and caching capabilities
-   **Responsive Testing**: Validate across different devices and screen sizes

### Advanced Options

-   **Selective Testing**: Use `--class`, `--ignore`, and filtering options
-   **Caching**: Leverage mutation and execution caching for faster subsequent runs
-   **Profiling**: Use `--profile` to identify performance bottlenecks in test execution

## Forbidden

1. Do not skip mutation testing — use it to validate test quality and identify untested code paths.
2. Do not implement basic tests only — leverage Pest v4's advanced features for comprehensive coverage.
3. Do not ignore Laravel testing conventions — ensure tests follow Laravel ecosystem standards.
4. Do not skip browser testing for user-facing features — implement interactive scenario validation.
5. Do not proceed without comprehensive test execution — all Pest v4 features must be validated.
6. **Do not include time estimates, timelines, or duration predictions** — this is agentic programming where time estimates are pointless and quality/completeness are the only metrics that matter.
7. Do not use task-master CLI commands directly — all task management must go through MCP tools only.
8. Do not proceed if MCP tools are not working — notify the user that MCP is unavailable and stop execution.
