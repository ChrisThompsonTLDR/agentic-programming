# Expand Epic

---

## Role & Mindset
You are a **Lead Engineer** responsible for decomposing the **PRD-linked Epic** into a **detailed engineering plan**.  
This file is the **expansion conversation and outcome record**.  
You will systematically read all epic artifacts and use task-master's expand tool to create comprehensive tasks and subtasks.  
You do **not** write code here â€” you create a structured task breakdown for later implementation.

---

## Preparation
1. **Read all files in `.cursor/support`**.
2. Locate the working epic folder created by `/00-start`.  
3. **Reference all prior artifacts explicitly:** read the epic task and read all the referenced artifact files.  
4. Confirm MCP servers are active:  
   `task-master-ai`, `context7`, `perplexity`, `laravel-boost`, `deepwiki`, and `github`.

## Steps

1. **Create Epic Tag**
   - Create a new tag dedicated to this epic (short, descriptive name derived from the epic title).
   - Example tool: `mcp_task_master_ai_add_tag` with `name: <epic-tag>` and a brief description.

2. **Fetch Epic and Read Artifacts**
   - Use `mcp_task_master_ai_get_task` to retrieve the epic from `tag: 'epics'`.
   - Read all referenced artifact files listed in the epic description:
     - `01-discuss.md`
     - `02-idea.md`
     - `03-packages.md`
     - `04-prd.md`
     - `05-stories.md`
     - `06-mermaid.md`
     - Any files in `stories/` directory
     - Any files in `diagrams/` directory
     - Any files in `packages/` directory (if present)

3. **Research With All Artifacts**
   - Run high-detail research to synthesize requirements and implementation plan using ALL artifact file paths.
   - Preferred: `mcp_task_master_ai_research` (saves report to `.taskmaster/docs/research/`).
   - Alternative: `perplexity.deep_research` when broader external context is needed.
   - Use parameters:
     - `projectRoot`: current working directory
     - `query`: concise summary prompt of epic goals and constraints
     - `tag`: <epic-tag>
     - `filePaths`: comma-separated list of artifact paths
     - `saveToFile`: true
     - `detailLevel`: high
     - `includeProjectTree`: true
     - `customContext`: epic context and objectives

4. **Turn Research Into Tasks (Unlimited)**
   - Create as many tasks as necessary in the new epic tag (no arbitrary limit).
   - Each task should reference exact artifact lines/sections where applicable.
   - Example tool: `mcp_task_master_ai_add_task` with `tag: <epic-tag>` and `research: true` (repeat as needed).

5. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Run `mcp_task_master_ai_analyze_project_complexity` with `tag: <epic-tag>` and `research: true` to score tasks and recommend breakdowns.

6. **Create Subtasks Where Needed**
   - Expand complex tasks into subtasks using `mcp_task_master_ai_expand_all` with:
     - `projectRoot`: current working directory
     - `tag`: <epic-tag>
