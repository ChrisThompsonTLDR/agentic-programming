# Gap Analysis Directory

This directory contains gap analysis documents generated by the `82-gap.md` command.

Gap analyses compare two items (packages, systems, approaches, implementations, etc.) and document:
- Capabilities present in one but missing in the other
- Overlapping capabilities with implementation differences
- Critical gaps affecting project requirements
- Recommendations for selection

Files in this directory follow the naming convention: `<slug>.md`
